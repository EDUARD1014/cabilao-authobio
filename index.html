            <h2>Early Years and Formative Moments</h2>
            <p>My childhood was spent in Pangan-an Lapu-Lapu City. I remember the first time I realized my interest in coding farming and etc.</p>
            <p>When I was in Elementary, I always do what is the thing that is wrong to do. I always do cutting classes, absent and not doing my homework.
               As the time pass by, when I was in junior high I realise that what I do before is a wrong doing. That's why I started dreaming high and seeking more responsibilities. Furthermore, when I was in Sernior High School, it helps me to plan and build my future.
               It makes me more competitive and responsible.</p>
